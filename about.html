              I've been searching years what I would like to do in my future. My
              friend was doing a JS-course, and I was very surprised, becouse
              she is kind of humanistic brain. I thought, "hm, maybe I'm gonna
              try?". So I started to search in google, on YT what is going on
              with this coding. Who can do it, how it looks like, is it really
              such a "black magic?". The day after, the cool algorythm started
              to show me some courses. And the first I got intersted to, was
              SheCodes. That I highly recommend each Woman! It's not usual
              course. It's a feminine-course, showing You coding in a very fun
              way! I had struggled a lot, like everybody I guess. There is no
              success without stuggling! But I didn't give up, and... here I am!
